# MPI Implementation Documentation (eggwar_mpi.c)
===============================================

DESCRIPTION:
-----------
This program simulates an Easter egg hunt using the Message Passing Interface (MPI)
for distributed parallel computing. It divides a 2D field into rows and assigns
different processes to search different sections of the field in parallel.

HOW IT WORKS:
-----------
1. The master process (rank 0) creates and initializes the field with randomly 
   placed eggs
2. The field is distributed to all worker processes
3. Each process searches its assigned portion of the field in parallel
4. Results are collected back at the master process for final reporting

COMPILATION:
----------
$ mpicc -o eggwar_mpi eggwar_mpi.c

EXECUTION:
---------
# Run with 4 MPI processes
$ mpirun -np 4 ./eggwar_mpi

# Run with verbose output
$ mpirun -np 4 ./eggwar_mpi -v

# Using Slurm
$ srun -n 4 ./eggwar_mpi

PARAMETERS:
----------
-v    Verbose mode - prints field contents and detailed search information

CONFIGURATION:
------------
The following parameters can be modified in the source code:
- N: Field size (NxN grid), default is 100x100
- E: Egg density percentage, default is 10% of grid cells
